<h3>This is the landing page for my website<h3>
<p>This is my personal website that I created</p>
<p>My name is Nathaniel Roland and I am a 1st year SMASH scholar.</p>
<p>Currntly I am attending SMASH Berkeley. During the time that i've been here I have become friends with so many amazing people, and I have met mentors, and proffesionals who have greatly influenced me.</p>
<p>I am new to coding but it is very interesting to me to see the posibilities. I can create countless things with all kind of different codes and to me it is fascinating. It is also challenging but when my code works it is a good feeling.<p>
